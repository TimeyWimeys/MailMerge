 A free to use mail web panel supporting postfix,dovecot,clamav & spamassassin

This is a personal project not used for production workplaces (yet).
Making this due to the lacking function of cloudpanel that only has functionality for databases, domain-management and ftp/sftp/ssh features.
This is an optional program to compliment cloudpanel. I'm a total beginner to coding, so expect a lot of bugs.
